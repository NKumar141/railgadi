# RailGadi

This is the repository for the RailGadi App

So the the vision for this project is to create an application for android and IOS platforms which will be a more User Needs Oriented version of Where Is My Train types of applications already available on the Play Store
By User's needs oriented i mean The application will be focused on assisting and managing and schedling and tracking Journeys , kind of an Travel Aid

For example there will be Notificitaions and reminders for the user as per his settings and personalizations
There will be Schedule tracking and THe whole Journey Tracking on the Actual Travel Day all throughout and will keep giving the user important informations about the travel .

For example the first thing will be Reading The PNR from the 139 msg and getting all the info about travel and using further APis to get as much info as possible and on the travel day there will be notification alert from the start of the day displaying the train status and seat no coach no ETA till the user boards the train then there it can simply keep showing how long the travel is remaining .

Then inside the application there will be several info like upcoming stations weather of upcoming stations etc and more and more info that we can give to the user

Then another thing is as per the train running status there can be alarms and reminders set for difrent tasks like boarding of or taking pickups on station as per the customization by the user 

Basically This application is to be made as an (Train Tracker + Personal Manager) combined . And the train Tracker is to be the most advanced in all the apps available on the play store
