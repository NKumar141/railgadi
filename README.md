# RailGadi

This is the repository for the RailGadi App.
So the the vision for this project is to create an application for android and IOS platforms which will be a more **User Needs Oriented** version of Where Is My Train types of applications already available on the Play Store By User's needs oriented i mean The application will be focused on assisting and managing and schedling and tracking Journeys , kind of an Travel Aid

For example, there will be notifications and reminders for the user as per his settings and personalizations. On the actual travel day, there will be schedule tracking and journey tracking throughout, giving the user important information about the journey.
For example, the first thing will be reading the PNR from the 139 messages and getting all the info about travel and using further APIs to get as much info as possible, and on the travel day there will be a notification alert from the start of the day displaying the train status and seat number, coach number, and ETA until the user boards the train, at which point it can simply keep showing how long the travel is remaining.

Then, within the application, there will be various pieces of information such as upcoming stations' weather, and so on, as well as more and more information that we can provide to the user.

Another feature is that as per the train's running status, there can be alarms and reminders set for different tasks like boarding or taking pickups at stations, as per the customization by the user.
Basically This application will be created as a hybrid (Train Tracker/Personal Manager). And the train tracker is supposed to be the most advanced of all the apps available on the Play Store.
